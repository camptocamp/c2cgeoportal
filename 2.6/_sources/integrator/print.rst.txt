Print
=====

Template configuration
----------------------

All print-related files are located in the ``print/`` folder, notably the print templates in the
``print/print-apps/<package>`` folder.

The main configuration file is ``print/print-apps/<package>/config.yaml``.

* `MapFish Print documentation <https://mapfish.github.io/mapfish-print-doc/>`_
* `Startup with Jasper Reports <https://mapfish.github.io/mapfish-print-doc/#/jasperReports>`_


Notes about the scales
----------------------

The web map and the map printing do not use the same scales. Therefore, if you change the configuration
of min/max scaling, you should also test map printing to be sure that it also works as expected.


Infrastructure
--------------

By default, the configuration is set up to the `mutualized print platform as a service from Camptocamp <https://www.camptocamp.com/en/actualite/saas-printing-service-offer/>`.

To use this platform, you should ask Camptocamp to create e.-g. two new applications on the platform,
one for the integration, one for the production.

Configure the application name in the ``MUTUALIZED_PRINT_APP`` variable of a ``Makefile``.

Development
-----------

To test the print locally, you can copy the ``docker-compose.override.sample.yaml`` to
``docker-compose.override.yaml``, and uncomment the ``PRINT_URL`` environment variable and the
``print`` service.

Local print
-----------

To use a local print service, you should:

* Set ``PRINT_URL`` to ``http://print:8080/print/`` in the ``env.project`` file.
* Uncomment the ``print`` service in the ``docker-compose.yaml`` file.
* Uncomment the ``!mapUri``, ``!forwardHeaders`` and ``!hostnameMatch`` in the print configuration.
* Uncomment the ``print``/``spec`` configuration section of the ``checker`` in the ``vars.yaml``.
