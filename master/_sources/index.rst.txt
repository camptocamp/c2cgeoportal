*Administrator* is the person who manages an application built with
c2cgeoportal. *Integrator* is the person who builds the c2cgeoportal
application, and does the initial setup. *Developer* is the person who
produces code for c2cgeoportal itself.

The c2cgeoportal project is composed of two software components: NGEO (a JS
library based on `OpenLayers <https://openlayers.org>`_ and
`AngularJS <https://angularjs.org/>`_ ), and c2cgeoportal, a Python library
for the Pyramid web framework. So c2cgeoportal applications are Pyramid
applications with user interfaces based on ExtJS and
OpenLayers.

One of the primary goals of the c2cgeoportal project is sharing as much as
functionality and code as possible between applications. *Do not repeat
ourselves!*
