*Administrator* is the person who manages an application built with c2cgeoportal. *Integrator* is the person
who builds the c2cgeoportal application, and does the initial setup. *Developer* is the person who
produces code for c2cgeoportal itself.

The c2cgeoportal project is composed of two software components: NGEO (a JS library based on
`OpenLayers <https://openlayers.org>`_ and `AngularJS <https://angularjs.org/>`_), and c2cgeoportal,
a Python library for the Pyramid web framework.

The `Demo <https://geomapfish-demo-2-7.camptocamp.com/>`_ application shows a WebGIS
built with c2cgeoportal.
The `Demo alternative UI <https://geomapfish-demo-2-7.camptocamp.com/desktop_alt>`_ shows
the same WebGIS with different user interface functionalities.
To test the editing functionality, you can use the username 'demo' with the password 'demo'.
