Administrator Guide
===================

This chapter describes how to install, deploy, and administrate a c2cgeoportal
application.

The application administrator configures and administrates the application
through the database. The administrator does not deal with the files of the
application (the integrator is the one responsible for these files). Except for
the map server files. Adding layers to the application indeed requires
inserting information in the database, as well as adding layers in the map
server.
