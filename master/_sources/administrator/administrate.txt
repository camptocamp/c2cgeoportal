.. _administrator_administrate:

Administrate a c2cgeoportal application
=======================================

The administration interface is located at ``http://<server>/<project>/admin``.

Authentication for the administration interface is done through the main application interface. Role ``role_admin`` is
required.

Layers
------

In the version 2 we split the layer table in 3 tables: 'layer_internal_wms',
'layer_external_wms', 'layer_wmts', and we copy the previous layer table in 'layerv1'.

And the 'order' will be moved in the relation of the tree.

All layer type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the layers in the admin interface have the following attributes:
 *  ``Name``: the name of the WMS layer/group, or he WMTS layer.
    It also used throw OpenLayers.i18n to display the name on the layers tree.

    throw the ``Restriction areas``.
 *  ``Restrictions area``: the areas through which the user can see the layer.

    You can use both ``WMS layers`` and ``Query layers`` if you want that

    If you want to define ``WMS layers`` but no ``Query layers``,
    set it to ``[]``.

URL
---

In the admin interface we can use in all the URL the following special schema:

* ``static``: to use a static route,

  * ``static:///icon.png`` will get the URL of the ``static`` static route of the project.
  * ``static://c2cgeoportal/icon.png`` will get the URL of the ``static`` static route of ``c2cgeoportal``.
  * ``static://prj:img/icon.png`` will get the URL of the ``img`` static route of ``prj``.

* ``config``: to get the server name from the URL, with the config from the ``vars`` file:

  .. code:: yaml

     servers:
        my_server: http://example.com/test

  ``config://my_server/icon.png`` will be transformed into
  the URL ``http://example.com/test/icon.png``.
