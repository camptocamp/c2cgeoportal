Administrate a c2cgeoportal application
=======================================

The administration interface is located at ``http://<server>/<project>/admin``.

Authentication for the administration interface is done through the main application interface. Role ``role_admin`` is
required.

.. _administrator_administrate_ogc_server:

OGC Server
----------

This is the description of an OGC server (WMS/WFS).
For one server we try to create only one request when it is possible.

If you want to query the same server to get PNG and JPEG images,
you should define two ``OGC servers``. Attributes:

* ``Name``: the name of the OGC Server.
* ``Description``: a description.
* ``URL``: the server URL, empty to use the internal mapserver.
* ``WFS support``: whether WFS is supported by the server.
* ``WFS URL``: the WFS server URL, empty to use the same as the ``URL``.
* ``Type``: the server type used to know which custom attribute will be used.
* ``Image type``: the MIME type of the images (e.g.: ``image/png``).
* ``Single tile``: whether to use the single tile mode (For future use).
* ``Auth``: the kind of authentication to use (For future use).

.. _administrator_administrate_metadata:

Metadata
--------

You can associate metadata to all theme elements (tree items).
The purpose of this metadata is to trigger specific features, mainly UI features.
Each metadata entry has the following attributes:

* ``Item``: the tree item the metadata is associated to.
* ``Name``: the type of ``Metadata`` we want to set (the available names are configured in the ``vars``
  files in ``admin_interface/available_metadata``).
* ``Value``: the value of the metadata entry.
* ``Description``: a description.

To set a metadata entry, create or edit an entry in the Metadata view of the administration UI.
Regarding effect on the referenced tree item on the client side, you will find a description for each sort of metadata in the `NGEO documentation <https://camptocamp.github.io/ngeo/master/apidoc/gmfThemes.GmfMetaData.html>`_.

Functionalities
---------------

``Roles`` and ``Themes`` can have some functionalities. Attributes:

* ``Name``: the type of Metadata we want to set (configured in the ``vars``
  files in ``admin_interface/available_functionalities``).
* ``Value``: the value of the metadata.
* ``Description``: a description.

Layers
------

In version 2, we split the layer table into 2 tables: ``layer_wms``,
``layer_wmts``, and we copy the previous layer table in ``layerv1``.
There is a tool to migrate the layers from the v1 structure to the v2
structure see ``./docker-run themev1tov2``.
Still using the CGXP application? Then you should maintain both version
of the layers, respectively ``layerv1`` and ``layer_wms``-``layer_wmts``.

And the ``order`` will be moved in the relation of the tree.

All layer type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the layers in the admin interface have the following attributes:

* ``Name``: the name of the WMS layer/group, or the WMTS layer.
  It also used throw OpenLayers.i18n to display the name on the layers tree.
* ``Public``: make the layer public, also it is accessible
  throw the ``Restriction areas``.
* ``Restrictions area``: the areas through which the user can see the layer.
* ``Related Postgres table``: the related postgres table,
  used by the :ref:`administrator_editing`.
* ``Exclude properties``: the list of attributes (database columns) that should not appear in
  the :ref:`administrator_editing` so that they cannot be modified by the end user.
  For enumerable attributes (foreign key), the column name should end with '_id'.
* ``Parents``: the groups and theme in which the layer is.
* ``Metadata``: Additional metadata.
* ``Dimensions``: the dimensions, if not provided default values are used (v2 only).

WMS layer
~~~~~~~~~
On internal WMS layers we have the following specific attributes:

* ``OGC Server``: the used server.
* ``Layers``: the WMS layers. Can be one layer, one group, a coma separated list of layers.
  In the case of a coma separated list of layers, we will get the legend rule for the
  layer icon on the first layer, and the legend will not be supported we should define a legend metadata.
* ``Style``: the used style, can be empty.
* ``Time mode``: used for the WMS time component.
* ``Time widget``: the used component type for the WMS time.

WMTS layer
~~~~~~~~~~

On WMTS layers we have the following specific attributes:

* ``GetCapabilities URL``: the URL to the WMTS capabilities.
* ``Layer``: the WMTS layer.
* ``Style``: the used style, if not present we use the default style.
* ``Matrix set``: the used matrix set, if there is only one matrix set
  in the capabilities it can be empty.

layerv1 (deprecated in v2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The layers in the admin interface have the following attributes:

* ``Metadata URL``: optional, for WMS, leave it empty to get it from the capabilities.
* ``Visible``: if it is false the layer is just ignored.
* ``Checked``: the layer is checked by default.
* ``Icon``: icon on the layer tree.
* ``KML 3D``: optional, URL to a KML to display it on the Google earth view.
* ``Display legend``: it checked the legend is display on the layer tree.
* ``Legend image``: URL to overwrite the default legend image.

  the given layer, used to zoom to visible scale, with WMS if it is empty
  we get the values from the capabilities.
* ``Disclaimer``: optional, copyright of the layer, used by
  `Disclaimer <http://docs.camptocamp.net/cgxp/2.2/lib/plugins/Disclaimer.html>`_.
* ``Identifier attribute field``: field used to identify a feature from the
  layer, e.g.: 'name', used by
  `FeaturesWindow <http://docs.camptocamp.net/cgxp/2.2/lib/plugins/FeaturesWindow.html>`_.
* ``Restrictions area``: the areas throw witch the user can see the layer.

On ``internal WMS`` layer we have the following specific attributes:

* ``Image type``: the type of the images.
* ``Style``: the used style, can be empty.
* ``Dimensions``: a JSON string that gives the dimensions,
  e.g.: ``{ "YEAR": "2012" }``, if not provided default values are used.

* ``Base URL``: the base URL of the WMS server.
* ``Image type``: the type of the images.
* ``Style``: the used style, can be empty.
* ``Legend rule``: the legend rule used to get the layer icon,

  specified.
* ``Query layers``: optional, a comma-separated list of WMS layers
  used for querying.
* ``WMS layers``: optional, a comma-separated list of layers used for
  printing, and for querying if ``Query layers`` is not set.

.. note::

    You can use both ``WMS layers`` and ``Query layers`` if you want that
    different sets of ``WMS layers`` are used for printing and querying.
    If you want to define ``WMS layers`` but no ``Query layers``,
    set it to ``[]``.

LayerGroup
----------

Attributes:

* ``Name``: used throw OpenLayers.i18n to display the name on the layers tree.
* ``Order``: used to order the layers and group on the layer tree.
* ``Metadata URL``: optional (deprecated in v2).
