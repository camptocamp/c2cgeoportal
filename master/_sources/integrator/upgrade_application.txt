Upgrading a GeoMapFish application
==================================

.. warning::

    From version 1.6 we use Alembic instead of sqlachemy-migrate for database migration.
    Than to upgrade to GeoMapFish 1.6, integrators must start from the very last release
    of 1.5 since the upgrades to 1.5 are no longer available with the new tool.

Using the c2ctool command
-------------------------

The ``c2ctool`` is a tool to facilitate the common operations around GeoMapFish.


Easy updating an application code
---------------------------------

.. prompt:: bash

   make -f <makefile> update
   make -f <makefile> build

Where ``<makefile>`` is your user make file (``<user>.mk``).


Easy upgrading an application
-----------------------------

.. note::

   To upgrade from version 1.6 to version 2.0 you should update the
   ``CONST_requirement.txt`` file::

   .. code:: diff

      \- --find-links http://pypi.camptocamp.net/internal-pypi/index/c2cgeoportal
      + --find-links https://camptocamp.github.io/c2cgeoportal/index/c2cgeoportal

   And run:

   .. prompt:: bash

      export UPGRADE_ARGS='--index-url https://camptocamp.github.io/c2cgeoportal/index/c2cgeoportal --c2cgeoportal-url https://github.com/camptocamp/c2cgeoportal/releases/download/%\(version\)/%\(package\)-%\(version\)-py2.py3-none-any.whl'


In the ``setup.py`` be sure not to specify a ``c2cgeoportal`` version,
because it will prevent the installation of the new ``c2cgeoportal`` egg.

We considers that your makefile is named ``<instanceid>.mk``, if it's not the case
add in your Makefile ``UPGRADE_MAKE_FILE = <user.mk>``

.. note:: For Windows:

   You should add ``UPGRADE_ARGS += --windows`` in your ``<package>.mk`` file.

Than just run:

.. prompt:: bash

   export VERSION=<target_version>
   make -f <makefile> upgrade

Where ``<makefile>`` is your user Makefile (``<user>.mk``),
``<target_version>`` is the version that you wish to upgrade to
(for the development version it should be 'master').

And follow the instructions.

.. note:: For Windows:

    If you are using Windows, you will have to execute some steps prior
    to the instructions hereunder:

    * Uninstall manually the old c2cgeoportal egg:

        ``.build/venv/Scripts/pip uninstall c2cgeoportal``

    * Clean / remove the generated files:

        ``make -f <makefile> clean``

    * Change the version in ``setup.py`` and ``CONST_requirements.txt``
      to the version you wish to install.
    * Build your application:

        ``make -f <makefile> build``

    *  Put your modifications under git revision:

        ``git add setup.py``

        ``git add CONST_requirements.txt``

        ``git commit -m "Upgrade c2cgeoportal version"``

        ``git push <remote> <branch>``

    * Follow the Windows instructions hereunder, note that you will have to use
      ``.build\venv\Scripts\...`` instead of ``.build\venv\bin\...`` in all given
      commands
