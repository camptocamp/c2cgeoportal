Configure short URL
===================

The configuration in ``vars_<project>.yaml`` looks like this:

.. code:: yaml

   shortener:
        # The base of created URL
        base_url:  http://${host}/${apache_entry_point}s/
        # Used to send a confirmation email
        email_from: info@camptocamp.com
        email_subject: You create the following short URL
        email_body: |
            Hello,

            You create the following short URL:
            short URL: %(short_url)s
            full URL: %(full_url)s

            The Mapfish team
        smtp_server: smtp.example.com
        # length (default) of ref of new short url
        # Can be change when you want
        # max 20 (size of the column)
        length: 4

The shortened URL is sent by email to the current registered user email address
unless another address has been provided through the email field in the
viewer interface.
