.. _integrator_create_application:

Create a new application
========================

Creating a new c2cgeoportal application is done by applying two Paste skeletons
(a.k.a. templates and scaffolds). These skeletons are provided by the
``c2cgeoportal`` package. So to be able to create a c2cgeoportal application
the ``c2cgeoportal`` package must be installed.

If you already have a c2cgeoportal application installed, and if that
application uses a version of c2cgeoportal that fits you, then you do not need
to install c2cgeoportal again. Instead, you can use the version of c2cgeoportal
that is already alongside the existing c2cgeoportal application.

.. note::

    Some c2cgeoportal applications provide their own skeletons. For example
    a *parent* application may provide a skeleton for creating *child*
    applications. In that case, the c2cgeoportal skeletons, as well as the
    application skeletons, should be applied.

Project structure
-----------------

In the simple case the root directory of the application is the directory
created by the c2cgeoportal skeletons (the ``c2cgeoportal_create`` and
``c2cgeoportal_update`` skeletons).

Install c2cgeoportal
--------------------

This step is required if you cannot, or do not want, to create the c2cgeoportal
application from an existing one. For example, if you are creating a child
application from an existing parent application, it means you already have
``c2cgeoportal`` installed, so you can just skip this section, and directly go
to the next.

Also, installing ``c2cgeoportal``, as described in this section, requires
access to the c2cgeoportal GitHub repository. If you cannot view the
https://github.com/camptocamp/c2cgeoportal page in your browser that means you
do not have the required permissions. Please contact Camptocamp in that case.

To get ``c2cgeoportal`` you first need to get the related docker image:

.. prompt:: bash

    docker pull camptocamp/geomapfish-build <release|version>
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camptocamp/c2cgeoportal/master/docker-run

List existing skeletons
-----------------------

To list the available skeletons/templates use the following command, either
from the root directory of c2cgeoportal (if you have followed the instructions
from the previous section), or from the root directory of the existing
c2cgeoportal application you want to create the new application from:

.. prompt:: bash

    ./docker-run pcreate -l

You should at least see the c2cgeoportal skeletons:

* c2cgeoportal_create
* c2cgeoportal_update

Create the new application
--------------------------

The first step in the project creation is to chose a project name
``<project>``, and a package name ``<package>``.

Normally the project name should be the same name as the Git repository name.

The package name should not contain an underscore (``_``) because of an
issue with Pip.

To create the application first apply the ``c2cgeoportal_create`` skeleton:

.. prompt:: bash

    ./docker-run pcreate -s c2cgeoportal_create <project>

.. note::

    Do not add any '/' after the project name.

You'll be asked to enter the SRID and the Apache vhost for this project. Note
that the default extent would be defined directly from the srid. You can change
it later.

.. note::

    You can define these information directly in the command line using
    parameters:

     .. prompt:: bash

         SRID=21781 EXTENT="420000 30000 900000 350000" \
            ./docker-run pcreate -s c2cgeoportal_create --package-name <package> <project>

This will create a directory named ``<project>`` that will be next to the
``c2cgeoportal`` directory, or to the directory of the application you are
creating this application from.

Now apply the ``c2cgeoportal_update`` skeleton:

.. prompt:: bash

    SRID=21781 ./docker-run pcreate -s c2cgeoportal_update --package-name <package> <project>

.. note::

    Do not add any '/' after the project name.

The ``c2cgeoportal_update`` scaffold is also used to update the
application. The files generated by this skeleton are prefixed with
``CONST_``, which means they are *constant* files that should not be changed.
Following this rule is important for easier updates.


Go to your new project:

.. prompt:: bash

    cd <project>


Put the application under revision control
------------------------------------------

Now is a good time to put the application source code under revision
control (Git preferably).

To add a project in a new repository
....................................

Add the project:

.. prompt:: bash

    git init
    git add .
    git remote add origin git@github.com:camptocamp/<project>.git

Commit and push on the main repository:

.. prompt:: bash

    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push origin master

Configuration of different environment in your project
------------------------------------------------------

Concepts
........

* Makefile: These files are environment configuration files. Each environment will
  have its configuration file (developer, preprod, prod)
* vars_xxx.yaml: These files are application configuration files. Generally only
  one file is needed to configure your application.

Hierarchy and extending your configuration files
................................................

The configuration files (Makefile and vars) have a hierarchy between them.
These files extend other files. A Makefile extends another Makefile
and similarly a vars file extends another vars file. This extension is visible
in Makefile files:

.. code:: make

   include CONST_Makefile

and vars files:

.. code:: yaml

    extends: CONST_vars.yaml

CONST files are files that should not be changed because they are replaced
during application updates, so your changes will be systematically lost. You can
extend these files as many times as you like, although it is not recommended to
exceed 3-4 levels for readability and simplicity.

.. image:: ../_static/doc_hierarchie.png

Whenever possible, it is strongly advised not to extend the
``vars_<project>.yaml`` file, and we recommend that you use dynamic variables as
described below. However some use cases may need to do so:

* Configuring really different environments.
* Configuration of a multi-project (see below for this specific use case).

Use of dynamic variable
.......................

Variables used in the application configuration files (files ``vars_<project>.yaml``)
can be made dynamic by means of environment variable. In the main file
``vars_<project>.yaml``, added the ``interpreted`` block at the bottom of the
file.

In this same file, you can change the value of a parameter by putting it in
uppercase (example: ``host: HOST``). This parameter must be listed in the
interpreted parameters section:

.. code:: yaml

    extends: CONST_vars.yaml

    vars:
        host: HOST
    ...
    interpreted:
        environment:
            - log_level
            - host

In the ``<project>.mk`` file, add parameters you want to change as exported
parameters:

.. code:: make

    export HOST = domaine.different.com
    export LOG_LEVEL

In the Makefiles that extend this main file, you only need to define the
environment variables:

.. code:: make

   export HOST = prod.different.com

Configure the application
-------------------------

As the integrator you need to edit the ``vars_<package>.yaml`` and
``<package>.mk`` files to configure the application.

Do not miss to add your changes to git:

.. prompt:: bash

    git add vars_<package>.yaml
    git commit -m "Configure the project"
    git push origin master

.. note::

    If you use the check collector do not miss to add the new child to
    the parent site check_collector configuration.

.. note::

   Additional notes for Windows users:

   To have a working PNG print you should get and edit the file
   ``print/WEB-INF/classes/imagemagick-mapfish-spring-application-context-override.xml``,
   get it:

   .. prompt:: bash

        wget https://raw.github.com/mapfish/mapfish-print/master/sample-spring/imagemagick/WEB-INF/classes/imagemagick-mapfish-spring-application-context-override.xml
        mv imagemagick-mapfish-spring-application-context-override.xml print/WEB-INF/classes/
        git add print/WEB-INF/classes/imagemagick-mapfish-spring-application-context-override.xml

   and replace the lines::

        <!-- <property name="cmd">
            <value>C:\Program Files\ImageMagick-6.7.8-Q16\convert</value>
        </property> -->

   by those ones::

        <property name="cmd">
            <value>C:\Program Files\ImageMagick-6.7.8-Q16\convert</value>
        </property>

   with the right path to ``convert``.

After creation and minimal setup the application is ready to be installed.
Then follow the sections in the install application guide:

* :ref:`integrator_install_application_create_schema`.
* :ref:`integrator_install_application_create_user`.
* :ref:`integrator_install_application_install_application`.

.. note::

   After that if you want a default theme you can run:

   .. prompt:: bash

      ./docker-compose-run create-demo-theme

.. note::

    If you create the main instance you should do the whole
    database creation as described in :ref:`integrator_install_application`,
    except the 'Get the application source tree' chapter.


Dynamic configuration and autogenerated files
---------------------------------------------

Several files are autogenerated, their content depending of the variables you
have set either in the main ``<package>.mk`` or a ``<user>.mk``

The files can have the extension ``.mako``

.mako
.....

If you use ``.mako``, you can also use all the possibilities allowed by the Mako
templating system, such as for loops, conditions, sub-templates, etc.

Please see the Mako documentation for details:

http://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/

The result is also a file without the .mako.

**Syntax**

In ``.mako`` files, the variable replacement syntax is as follows::

  ${<variablename>}

for example:

* ``${directory}``
