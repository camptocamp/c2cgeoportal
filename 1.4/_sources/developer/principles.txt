Principles
==========

This section includes development principles and guidelines. It is important to
know and respect these principles, for ``c2cgeoportal`` as well as for projects
based on ``c2cgeoportal``.

* We want our code to be covered by automated tests.
* No ``z3c.recipe.filetemplate`` templates (``.in``) for files including code
  (``.py``, ``.js``, ``.css``, etc.).
