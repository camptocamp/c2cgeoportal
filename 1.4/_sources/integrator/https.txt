HTTPS
=====

If your application is accessed in HTTPS, you have to make sure that all URLs
generated by the application (CSS and Javascript files, images, MapServer
requests, etc.) use the HTTPS scheme as well. Otherwise the browser will
prompt "unsecure content" warnings.

If the application is placed behind some proxy that removes the SSL encryption
(plain HTTP is used between the proxy and the server) then some specific
configuration is required both on the c2cgeoportal application, and on the
proxy:

* The proxy should add a specific header to the requests. For example ``X-Https
  on`` (``X-Https`` is the header name, and ``on`` is the header value).
* To make c2cgeoportal generate HTTPS URLs when requests with this header are
  received you will set the `HTTPS` environment variable by adding the
  following in the ``apache/wsgi.conf.in`` file in the ``<location ...>``
  section, in our example::

    SetEnvIf    X-Https on HTTPS=1

In Mako templates, if you need to know what scheme is used, you may test the
value of ``request.scheme``. For example::

    var WMTS_OPTIONS = {
    % if request.scheme == 'https':
        url: 'https://my.wmts.server/'
    % else:
        url: 'http://my.wmts.server/'
    % endif
    /* ... */
    };
