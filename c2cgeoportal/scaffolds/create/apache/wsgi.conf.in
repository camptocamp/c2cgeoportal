# The Apache mod_wsgi configuration file.

# We use mod_wsgi's daemon mode. And we assign a specific process
# group to the WSGI application.
#
# Note: once we use mod_wsgi 3 we'll be able to get rid of the
# Location block by passing process-group and application-group
# options to the WSGIScriptAlias directive.

# uncomment this if you need HTTP authentication/authorization to work (with
# repoze.who or any other security toolkit), see the Apache mod_wsgi FAQ to
# understand why mod_wsgi doesn't pass the user credentials to the WSGI
# application by default.
