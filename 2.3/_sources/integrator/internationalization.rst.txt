Internationalization
====================

---------------
ngeo and server
---------------

In the file ``<package>.mk``, define the supported languages with (default):

.. code:: make

   LANGUAGES ?= en fr de

In the file ``vars.yaml``, define the available and default locales:

.. code:: yaml

   vars:
        ...
        default_locale_name: fr
        available_locale_names: [en, fr, de]

In the file ``language_mapping``, define any desired locale variants, for example:

.. code:: make

   fr=fr-ch

Build your application.

The files to translate are:

* ``geoportal/<package>_geoportal/locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/demo-client.po`` for the ngeo client
* ``geoportal/<package>_geoportal/locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/demo-server.po`` for the server part (should be empty for ngeo interfaces)

.. note::

   All the ``#, fuzzy`` strings should be verified and the line should be removed
   (if the line is not removed, the localisation will not be used).

To update the ``po`` files, you must run this specific target:

.. code:: bash

   ./docker-run make --makefile=<package>.mk update-po

.. note::

   You should run this command when you change something in the following:

     * layer in mapfile (new or modified)
     * layer in administration (new or modified)
     * raster layer in the vars file (new or modified)
     * print template
     * full text search
     * application (JavaScript and HTML files)
     * layer enumeration
     * some metadata as disclaimer
     * editable layer (database structure, data or enumerations)

Translations of the browser interfaces (main viewer, edit interfaces and APIs)
are included in two kinds of Javascript files, stored in
``<package>/static/js/Proj/Lang/``:

* ``<lang>.js`` is used to translate data-related strings such as layernames or
  attributenames (in interrogation results). It is based upon the OpenLayers
  translation syntax. For instance::

      OpenLayers.Util.extend(OpenLayers.Lang.<lang>, {
          "layertree": "Themes"
      });

* ``GeoExt-<lang>.js`` is used to adapt the translations of existing plugins/widgets
  or to add translations of project-specific plugins. It is based upon the GeoExt
  translation syntax. Key-value translation pairs are encapsulated by class.
  For instance::

      GeoExt.Lang.add("<lang>", {
          "cgxp.tree.LayerTree.prototype": {
              moveupText: "Move up"
          }
      });

.. note::

    <lang> is the `ISO 639-1 code <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`_.
    For example: en, de or fr.

.. note::

    Standard translations for CGXP plugins/widgets strings are available on
    `Github <https://github.com/camptocamp/cgxp/tree/master/core/src/script/CGXP/locale>`_.

.. note::

    Translations from both OpenLayers- and GeoExt-based systems are stored in
    separated files because of API constraints. Read more at :ref:`integrator_api_i18n`.
