We have release JSTools 0.6 on pypi.python.org. This version includes bug
fixes, for Windows in particular. c2cgeoportal 0.5 requires JSTools 0.6, so the
version of JSTools should be set to 0.6 in the buildout configuration of
c2cgeoportal projects (section [versions]).

Because OpenLayers has been upgraded, one must replace
OpenLayers/Layer/XYZ.js
by
OpenLayers/Layer/OSM.js
in the [app.js] "include" section of jsbuild/app.cfg.

-------------------------------

In the <package>/template/viewer.js file, in the block 'viewer_layers'
remove the last comma for IE, see commit 11d373b.

-------------------------------

Thu, 26 Jan 2012 13:21:20 +0100

Not required but recommended: you can edit your project's development.ini.in
and production.ini.in files and remove the [app:c2cgeoportal] section and its
content (one line). This section was needed for c2cgeoportal's manage_db and
create_db scripts to know the project package name, but it's not needed
anymore. For example, the manage_db script now has --app-name and --app-config
options.

-------------------------------

Thu, 12 Jan 2012 13:35:23 +0100

Due to wrong moving the files in 'print/print'. If exists the folder 
'print/print/WEB-INF/' should be moved to 'print/WEB-INF/' and the 
folder 'print/print/' should be removed.

-------------------------------

This migration concerns the changes reorganizing the "create" and "update"
paste templates.

* update the version of c2cgeoportal requirement in the project setup.py
so that c2cgeoportal dependency version is == 0.3.2. You should have:
    install_requires=[
        'PasteScript',
        'c2cgeoportal==0.3.2',
    ],
Then launch buildout to retrieve this new version of the egg c2cgeoportal.

* apply the 'update' template

* the manage_db script is now handled by c2cgeoportal again (this revert
the change introduced in c2cgeoportal v0.3.1):
  * update console_scripts entry points in the project setup.py, you should
  now have:
       'console_scripts': [
           'create_db = <package_name>.scripts.create_db:main',
       ],
  * remove the script manage_db from the project:
    $$ svn rm <package_name>/scripts/CONST_manage_db.py

* rename the following files:
    $$ svn mv apache/CONST_frontend.conf.in apache/frontend.conf.in
    $$ svn mv apache/CONST_mapserver.conf.in apache/mapserver.conf.in
    $$ svn mv apache/CONST_README.txt.in apache/README.txt.in
    $$ svn mv apache/CONST_tilecache.conf.in apache/tilecache.conf.in
    $$ svn mv apache/CONST_wsgi.conf.in apache/wsgi.conf.in
    $$ svn mv CONST_development.ini.in development.ini.in
    $$ svn mv CONST_production.ini.in production.ini.in
These files used to be generated by the update template, they're now generated
by the create template, this is why the CONST_ prefix is removed.
You can also update the svn:ignore property appropriately.

* add a .httpauth file in the project directory (if not already existing),
which contains the required credentials to access to our pypi internal server.
This file is generated when the 'create' template is applied so you have to
create it by hand.
This file should contain the following line:
    "C2C internal pypi server, http://pypi.camptocamp.net/internal-pypi, <login>, <password>"
(where <login> and <password> are to be replaced by the the Camptocamp internal
pypi server login/password)

-------------------------------

Wed, 14 Dec 2011 17:17:56 +0100

The files jsbuild/CONST_app.cfg and jsbuild/app.cfg should be merged together.
Finally jsbuild/CONST_app.cfg should be removed and all jsbuild configuration
should sit in jsbuild/app.cfg.

-------------------------------

/!\ ATTENTION:
Note that you cannot upgrade to c2cgeoportal version >= 0.3.2 directly.
You have to upgrade to v0.3.1 first, see below. 

-------------------------------

VERSION 0.3.1

Thu, 08 Dec 2011 10:00:00 +0100

This migration concerns the changes about distributing c2cgeoportal as an egg.

Once project is up to date (svn update) and the 'update' template has been
applied, the project should also be updated in the following ways:

* remove svn:externals to c2cgeoportal and rm -rf c2cgeoportal directory

* update console_scripts entry points in the project setup.py so that script
manage_db now refers to <package_name>.scripts.CONST_manage_db:main. You should
have:
       'console_scripts': [
           'create_db = <package_name>.scripts.create_db:main',
           'manage_db = <package_name>.scripts.CONST_manage_db:main',
       ],

* update the version of c2cgeoportal requirement in the project setup.py
so that c2cgeoportal dependency version is == 0.3.1. You should have:
    install_requires=[
        'PasteScript',
        'c2cgeoportal==0.3.1',
    ],

* add a migrate.cfg file in
MyProject/myproject/CONST_migration/migrate.cfg
This migrate.cfg file is generated when the 'create' template is applied so
you have to create it by hand. The version_table parameter value should
be set to "version_<package_name>".

The content of the migrate.cfg file should look like this:

    [db_settings]
    # Used to identify which repository this database is versioned under.
    # You can use the name of your project.
    repository_id=c2cgeoportal

    # The name of the database table used to track the schema version.
    # This name shouldn't already be used by your project.
    # If this is changed once a database is under version control, you'll need to
    # change the table name in each database too.
    version_table=version_<package_name>

    # When committing a change script, Migrate will attempt to generate the
    # sql for all supported databases; normally, if one of them fails - probably
    # because you don't have that database installed - it is ignored and the
    # commit continues, perhaps ending successfully.
    # Databases in this list MUST compile successfully during a commit, or the
    # entire commit will fail. List the databases your application will actually
    # be using to ensure your updates to that database work properly.
    # This must be a list; example: ['postgres','sqlite']
    required_dbs=[]

* rename the version table to match the name set in the version_table
parameter:
    ALTER TABLE <old_name> RENAME TO version_<package_name>
with <old_name> replaced by the old name of the version table which is
certainly the application's db schema name.

-------------------------------

Implements group restriction to acces to the admin interface.

To continue to acces to the admin interface you should, in the file
'<project>/__init__.py' replaxe the line
-     authentication_policy = AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy(settings.get('authtkt_secret'))
by:
+     authentication_policy = AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy(settings.get('authtkt_secret'),
+            callback=defaultgroupsfinder)
and add the import:
+ from c2cgeoportal.resources import defaultgroupsfinder.

-------------------------------

Wed, 07 Dec 2011 15:10:57 +0100

CGXP mode from SVN to GIT(hub).
Now we use a buildout task to do the clone.

To update your project do:
$$ svn propdel svn:externals ${package}/static/lib/
$$ rm -rf ${package}/static/lib/cgxp
$$ svn propset svn:ignore cgxp ${package}/static/lib/

work correctly.

In the jsbuild/app.cfg, CGXP/plugins/Redlining.js should be replaced by
CGXP/widgets/RedliningColorPicker.js for the new colorpicker or by
CGXP/widgets/RedliningCombo.js to have the old combobox.
