.. _administrator_administrate:

Administrate a c2cgeoportal application
=======================================

The administration interface is located at ``http://<server>/<project>/admin``.

Authentication for the administration interface is done through the main application interface. Role ``role_admin`` is
required.

Layers
------

In the version 2 we split the layer table in 3 tables: ``layer_internal_wms``,
``layer_external_wms``, ``layer_wmts``, and we copy the previous layer table in ``layerv1``.

And the ``order`` will be moved in the relation of the tree.

All layer type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the layers in the admin interface have the following attributes:
 *  ``Name``: the name of the WMS layer/group, or the WMTS layer.
    It also used throw OpenLayers.i18n to display the name on the layers tree.
 *  ``Public``: make the layer public, also it is accessible
    throw the ``Restriction areas``.
 *  ``Restrictions area``: the areas through which the user can see the layer.
 *  ``Related Postgres table``: the related postgres table,
    used by the :ref:`administrator_editing`.
 *  ``Exclude properties``: the list of attributes (database columns) that shouldn't appear in
    the :ref:`administrator_editing` so that they cannot be modified by the end user.
    For enumerable attributes (foreign key), the column name should end with '_id'.
 *  ``Parents``: the groups and theme in which the layer is.
 *  ``UI Metadata``: Additional metadata used by the UI.

.. note::
    You can use both ``WMS layers`` and ``Query layers`` if you want that
    different sets of WMS layers are used for printing and querying.
    If you want to define ``WMS layers`` but no ``Query layers``,
    set it to ``[]``.

LayerGroup

    if false it can include only ``external WMS`` or ``WMTS`` layers.
 *  ``Group of base layers``: if not ``Internal WMS`` replace radio button by check box (deprecated in v2).

URL
---

In the admin interface we can use in all the URL the following special schema:

* ``static``: to use a static route,

  * ``static:///icon.png`` will get the URL of the ``static`` static route of the project.
  * ``static://c2cgeoportal/icon.png`` will get the URL of the ``static`` static route of ``c2cgeoportal``.
  * ``static://prj:img/icon.png`` will get the URL of the ``img`` static route of ``prj``.

* ``config``: to get the server name from the URL, with the config from the ``vars`` file:

  .. code:: yaml

     servers:
        my_server: http://example.com/test

  ``config://my_server/icon.png`` will be transformed into
  the URL ``http://example.com/test/icon.png``.
