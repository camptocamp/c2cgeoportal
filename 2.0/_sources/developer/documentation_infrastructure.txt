Documentation infrastructure
============================

c2cgeoportal
------------

The c2cgeoportal documentation is publicly available at
https://camptocamp.github.io/c2cgeoportal/master/.

It is generated by Travis-ci after all commits on the concerned branches.

ngeo
----

The ngeo documentation is publicly available at
https://camptocamp.github.io/ngeo/master/apidoc/.

It is generated by Travis-ci after all commits on the concerned branches.

CGXP
----

The CGXP documentation is publicly available at
http://docs.camptocamp.net/cgxp/.

The ``docs.camptocamp.net`` server has an ``@hourly`` cronjob that runs the
``update_online.sh`` script, which is in the ``core/src/doc`` directory of
cgxp.

To manually update the online doc you can log onto ``docs.camptocamp.net`` as
``sig``, change directory to
``/var/www/vhosts/docs.camptocamp.net/private/cgxp/core/src/doc`` and run
``update_online.sh`` from there.

.. note::

    The initial ``git clone`` of cgxp, and the cron configuration are managed
    by puppet. Contrary to c2cgeoportal there's no need for a GitHub deploy
    key, as the CGXP repository is public.
