Organisation
------------

The main page where we can redefine the header
is in the file: ``<package>/templates/<interface>.html``.

Where ``<interface>`` is the interface name or "index" for the default interface.

The viewer (map and all related tools)
is define in the file: ``<package>/static-ngeo/js/<interface>.js``.

Where ``<interface>`` is the interface name or "main" for the default interface.

And finally the image should be placed in the folder is ``<package>/static-ngeo/images/``.

The style sheet file for all the project is ``<package>/static-ngeo/less/<package>.less``.

The style sheet file for one interface is ``<package>/static-ngeo/less/<interface>.less``.

HTML file
=========

In this file you can add some blocks like:

.. code:: html

   <gmf-authentication id="login" class="slide" data-header-title="Login">
   </gmf-authentication>

Witch is used to include a directive.

You can find the available directive in the
`ngeo documentation <http://camptocamp.github.io/ngeo/master/apidoc/>`_
in the sections 'gmf/Directives' and 'ngeo/Directives'.

All the directives should provide an example.

At the end of the file you find something like:

.. code:: html

    <script>
      (function() {
         var module = angular.module('<package>');
         var serverVars = {
             /**
              * Here the i18n is configured
              */
           serviceUrls: {
             /**
              * Here you configure the services URL
              */
           }
         };
         module.constant('serverVars', serverVars);
       })();
    </script>


Controller (js file)
====================

In the controler you have some lines like:

.. code:: javascript

   /** @suppress {extraRequire} */
   goog.require('gmf.authenticationDirective');

This is needed to include the javascript of the used directives.

The map configuration will be here:

.. code:: javascript

   goog.base(
         this, {
           srid: 21781,
           mapViewConfig: {
             center: [632464, 185457],
             zoom: 3,
             resolutions: [250, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05]
           }
         },
         $scope, $injector);

.. note::

   The resolutions should be the same as in the previus CGXP application to have
   backward compatible permalinks.

Background layers
=================

The background layers are configured in the database, with the layer group named
**background** (by default).

WMTS Layers
===========

To make the WMTS queryable you should add those UI Metadata:

* ``ogcServer`` with the name of the used OGC server,
* ``layers`` or ``queryLayers`` with the layers to query (groups not supported).

To print the layers in the high quality you you should add those UI Metadata:

* ``ogcServer`` with the name of the used OGC server,
* ``layers`` or ``printLayers`` with the layers to print.

.. note::
