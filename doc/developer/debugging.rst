Application debugging
=====================

The goal of this document is to give some troubleshooting tips.

Browser
-------

Using a browser-integrated debugging tool usually available with the ``F12`` key.

Sources map
-----------

For debugging purposes, it is better to have all the JavaScript and Style Sheets in separated, non-minified
files. To achieve this, you can simply use the sources maps, function activable in the browsers debugging
tool.

Webpack
-------

To have faster builds you need to use the Webpack dev server; you can achieve this as follows.

In the file ``geoportal/demo_geoportal/static-ngeo/js/apps/<interface>.html.ejs``,
remove the ``ng-strict-di`` in the ``html`` tag.

If it's not already done copy the file ``docker-compose.override.sample.yaml`` to
``docker-compose.override.yaml``.
Be sure thate the service ``webpack_dev_server`` is present and uncommented.

Restart your application as usual.

Open the application at the following URL: ``https://<host>/<entry_point>/dev/<interface>.html``.

Pyramid
-------

If the ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` is enabled, the error is directly shown in the query that fails.

Mapserver
---------

Sometimes, more information can be obtained by using this command:

.. prompt:: bash

    docker-compose exec mapserver shp2img -m <mapfile> -o test.png -e <minx> <miny> <maxx> <maxy> \
        -s <sizex> <sizey> -l <layers>

You may also activate MapServer's debug mode and set the environment variable ``MS_DEBUGLEVEL``
of the MapServer container ``MS_DEBUGLEVEL`` to ``5`` (most verbose level, default is 0).

`More information <http://mapserver.org/optimization/debugging.html?highlight=debug#debug-levels>`_

PostgreSQL
----------

In the configuration file ``/etc/postgresql/9.*/main/postgresql.conf``,
you can set ``log_statement`` to ``all`` to see all the called statements.
This file must be edited using the ``postgres`` user.

Reloading PostgreSQL is required so that the new configuration is taken into
account:

.. prompt:: bash

    sudo /etc/init.d/postgres reload

Logs are available in the ``/var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.*-main.log`` file.

Makefile
--------

To obtain additional debug messages, you can rebuild your project as follows:

.. prompt:: bash

   ./docker-run --env=DEBUG=TRUE make ...

It will add a message at the start of each rule with the list of files that required an update, e.-g.:

.. code::

   Build /build/c2ctemplate-cache.json due modification on vars.yaml
   -rw-r--r-- 1 sbrunner geomapfish 1321 2019-01-09 16:59:20.845623078 +0000 /build/c2ctemplate-cache.json
   -rw-rw-r-- 1 sbrunner geomapfish 1299 2019-01-10 08:31:35.707376156 +0000 vars.yaml

Docker-compose
--------------

Logs
....

With the following command you can access the logs:

.. prompt:: bash

   docker-compose logs [<service_name>]

Go inside a container
.....................

With the following command you can get a terminal in a container:

.. prompt:: bash

   docker-compose exec [--user=root] <service_name> bash

Multiple dev on one server
..........................

When you want to run multiple instances on the same server you should:

- Use a different docker tag for each instance
- Use a different project name for each instance

Use a different docker tag
..........................

Just define an environment variable in the build:

.. prompt:: bash

   DOCKER_TAG=<tag> ./docker-run make build


Developing in Python
--------------------

Create a development docker-compose.override.yaml
.................................................

If it's not already done copy the file ``docker-compose.override.sample.yaml`` to
``docker-compose.override.yaml``.

Be sure that the volume for the project is not commented.

You can also do a graceful restart of the running gunicorn:

.. prompt:: bash

   docker-compose exec geoportal bash
   kill -s HUP `ps aux|grep gunicorn|head --lines=1|awk '{print $2}'`  # graceful

And finally if you restart the container you will see your modifications:

.. prompt:: bash

   docker-compose restart geoportal

Working on c2cgeoportal itself
..............................

Clone and build c2cgeoportal, see :ref:`developer_server_side`.

If it's not already done copy the file ``docker-compose.override.sample.yaml`` to
``docker-compose.override.yaml``.
Be sure that the volumes for c2cgeoportal are uncommented.

Access to a hidden service
--------------------------

Within the Docker composition you can access a port of a container, you can achieve this via curl, e.-g.:

.. prompt: bash

   curl "http://mapserver:8080?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetCapabilities"

You can also expose a service out of the Docker composition. For that, add a port in your
``docker-compose.yaml``, e.g.:

.. code:: yaml

   services:
     <service>:
       port:
         - 8086:8080

Be careful one port can be open only one time on a server.

Use a specific version of ngeo
------------------------------

Clone ngeo and build:

.. prompt:: bash

   cd geoportal
   git clone https://github.com/camptocamp/ngeo.git
   cd ngeo
   git check <branch>
   npm install
   npm prepublish
   cd ../..

Add the following alias in your ``webpack.apps.js.mako`` file:

.. code:: js

    resolve: {
      alias: {
        <package>: ...,
   +    ngeo: path.resolve(__dirname, 'ngeo/src'),
   +    gmf: path.resolve(__dirname, 'ngeo/contribs/gmf/src'),
      }
    }

Force rebuild the application:

.. prompt:: bash

   ./docker-run rm /build/apps.<interface>.timestamp
   ./docker-run make build


Performance or network error
----------------------------

For performance and proxy issues, make sure that all internal URLs in the config file
use localhost (use ``curl "http://localhost/<path>" --header Host:<server_name>``
to test it).

TileCloud chain
...............

Points to check with TileCloud chain:

* Disabling metatiles should be avoided.
* Make sure that ``empty_metatile_detection`` and ``empty_tile_detection`` are configured correctly.
* Make sure to not generate tiles with a resolution higher than the one in the raster sources.
