HTTPS
=====

*New in c2cgeoportal 0.8.*

If your application is accessed in HTTPS, you have to make sure that all URLs
generated by the application (CSS and Javascript files, images, MapServer 
requests, etc.) use the HTTPS scheme as well. Otherwise the browser will
prompt "unsecure content" warnings.

If the application is placed behind some proxies that remove the SSL 
encryption, you may add in the application configuration some HTTP header flag
whose value will be tested in order to figure out if the URL must be generated
using the HTTPS scheme. This flag must be provided in the HTTP headers that
c2cgeoportal receives.

Example of configuration:

Edit ``config.yaml.in`` (in this example we use the ``X_HTTPS`` flag)::

        https_flag_header = X_HTTPS
        https_flag_value = on

In some Mako template, if you need to know what scheme is used, you may test
the value of ``request.scheme``.
