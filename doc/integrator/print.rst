Using MapFish Print v3
----------------------

Template configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All print-related files are located in the ``print/`` folder, and the files related to the template in the
``print/print-apps/<package>`` folder.

The main configuration file is ``print/print-apps/<package>/config.yaml``.

* `MapFish print documentation <http://mapfish.github.io/mapfish-print-doc/>`_
* `Startup with Jasper Reports <http://mapfish.github.io/mapfish-print-doc/#/jasperReports>`_


Using a single print server in a set of sites
---------------------------------------------

For memory issues it is recommended to only use a single print server for a set of sites.

For that we need to have only one ``vars_<project>.yaml`` which can easily be
generated by the templating. Then we should do:

* Remove the print from the ``children`` projects by
  removing the ``print`` folder:

  .. prompt:: bash

    git rm print

* Deactivate the print compilation by adding the following lines
  in the ``<package>.mk`` file:

  .. code:: make

    PRINT_VERSION = NONE

* Point to the parent print server by editing the following lines
  in the ``vars.yaml`` file:

  .. code:: yaml

    vars:
        ...
        # For print proxy
        # This value means that we use the parent print server
        print_url: http://{host}:8080/print/pdf/

* If needed set the print templates used by anonymous users by adding the
  following in the application configuration (``vars.yaml``):

  .. code:: yaml

     vars:
       ...
       functionalities:
           anonymous:
               print_template:
               - 1 A4 child
               - 2 A3 child


Having a dedicated print instance
---------------------------------

The goal is to be able to create a custom makefile with which one we make:

.. prompt:: bash

   make --makefile=<file>.mk

To have only the print.

For this, create a makefile with:

.. code:: yaml

   BUILD_RULES = test-packages print
   TEST_PACKAGES = main print
