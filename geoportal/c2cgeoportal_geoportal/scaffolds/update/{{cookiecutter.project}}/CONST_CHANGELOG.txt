This file includes migration steps for each release of c2cgeoportal.

=============
Version 2.8.1
=============

1. Update dependencies to use GDAL 3.7

   Use MapServer 8.0 with GDAL 3.7 (instead of 3.6)
   Use QGIS server 3.28 with GDAL 3.7 (instead of 3.6)
   Use GDAL 3.7 as based image (instead of 3.6)

=============
Version 2.8.0
=============

Information to know before starting the upgrade
===============================================


Information
===========

1. We upgraded MapServer to version 8, then the Mapfiles should probably be updated, and we have a new
   configurations file named `mapserver/mapserver.conf`.
   Migration guide: https://mapserver.org/MIGRATION_GUIDE.html#mapserver-7-6-to-8-0-migration.
   Deprecated element from `CLASS` removed (moved to `STYLE`)
   https://mapserver.org/development/rfc/ms-rfc-133.html#rfc133.

2. We added the support of 'main_ogc_server' to WMS mapserver proxy URL.
   This means that if the value 'vars/main_ogc_server' is present in the vars.yaml of the project,
   that will be used as default value when no 'ogcserver' parameter is present in the request.

3. We switched the OpenLayers renderer to now use WegGL for WMTS. In the case of background tiles with
   transparency, you should add the parameter 'ngeoTilesPreloadingLimit: 0' to the vars.yaml in 'constants'
   so that background tiles are rendered correctly.

4. In the `user` table, the column `deactivated` is now interpreted more strictly, `null` is now considered as `true`.

5. We add the `gmfPrintOptions` in the update path then the default print options are maintained in the
   `CONST_vars.yaml`, especially the `hiddenAttributes`, then if you used the default value it can be
   removed.
