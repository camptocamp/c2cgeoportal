This file includes migration steps for each release of c2cgeoportal.


=============
Version 2.7.1
=============

1. Update dependencies to use GDAL 3.7

   Use MapServer 7.6 with GDAL 3.7 (instead of 3.3) with new Ubuntu version
   Use QGIS server 3.28 (instead of 3.22) with GDAL 3.7
   Update rasterio to 1.3.9 (instead of 1.2.10)
   Use GDAL 3.7 as based image with new Ubuntu version (Python 3.8 => 3.10)
   Downgrade PyYAML to version 5.3.1 (instead of 5.4.1)
   Downgrade transifex-client to version 0.12.5 (instead of 0.14.4)


=============
Version 2.7.0
=============

Information to know before starting the upgrade
===============================================

1. Now the simple application is the default mode for new project, to continue with the advance application
   mode you also should add an attribute ``advance: true`` in your ``project.yaml`` file before starting
   the upgrade.

2. All the files will be formatted with isort, Black and Prettier to be similar to the initial scaffolds.
   If you have mako files in ``.html`` files Prettier will break them, to avoid that you should create
   ``.prettierignore`` file with:

   ```
   *.min.js
   ```

   And the files you want to ignore.

3. The Upgrade to the Web Components started, the authentication and the LiDAR profile are migrated.
   In the desktop_alt we introduce a canvas component who manage the application layout and plug the
   components through slots.
   In ngeo, the sources files from contribs/gmf/src are moved in ngeo src folder.

4. When importing external WMS layers through dedicated right panel in desktop interface, now we use the URL
   from Capabilities/Request/GetMap/.../OnlineResource tag instead of Service/OnlineResource tag which,
   regarding WMS specification, should contain the website URL.

Information
===========

1. The configuration of the QGIS authentication module is simplified,
   now a new environment variable `GEOMAPFISH_ACCESSCONTROL_BASE_URL` is set to the base URL of
   qgisserver, and we search for all the OGC servers that correspond to this URL.
   Then the configuration file  (`qgisserver/accesscontrol_config.yaml`) and the specified configuration
   in the `docker-compose.yaml` file can be removed.
   It also requires that the OGC servers are configured with an URL like that
   ``config://qgisserver?map=<project_file>``.

2. Some little changes in the application build:

   - In the ``./build`` script, we no longer call the ``docker build`` command with custom parameters,
     but call the ``docker-compose build`` command with two additional environment variables:

     * ``SIMPLE``: ``TRUE`` or ``FALSE`` if we compile a simple or advance application.
     * ``GIT_HASH``: the git hash of the current version.

     The build specification has been moved to the ``docker-compose`` files.
   - The ``--geoportal`` and ``--config`` arguments have been replaced by ``--service=geoportal`` and
     ``--service=config`` respectively.
   - The external images used in the composition are pulled from the Docker hub on each build, but the
     ``./build`` script supports a new argument ``--no-pull`` for faster rebuild during development.
   - ``./build`` script supports a new argument ``--fast-reload`` that will recreate all containers except
     Redis containers to keep the cache.
   - ``./build`` script supports a new argument ``--dry-run`` which only displays the ``docker`` and
     ``docker-compose`` commands without running them.

3. Upgrade c2cwsgiutils to version 5, see more information in the
   c2cwsgiutils changelog https://github.com/camptocamp/c2cwsgiutils/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md.

SQLAlchemy upgrade to version 1.4
---------------------------------

SQLAlchemy has been upgraded to version 1.4 which serves as potential migration point for a more dramatic
series of API changes currently planned for release 2.0 of SQLAlchemy.

For more details about SQLAlchemy 1.4 see: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/changelog/migration_14.html

To show SQLAlchemy deprecation warnings in your geoportal container logs, add this to your
`docker-compose.override.yaml` file:

```
---
version: '2.3'

services:
  geoportal:
    environment:
      - PYTHONWARNINGS=default::DeprecationWarning
      - SQLALCHEMY_WARN_20=true
```

For more information about Python warnings configuration see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#describing-warning-filters


Changes to apply
================

1. For advance application:

   In the ``docker-compose.yaml`` file in the service ``geoportal`` you should replace
   ``service: geoportal`` by ``service: geoportal-advance``, and in service ``alembic`` you should replace
   ``service: alembic`` by ``service: alembic-advance``.

2. If you use the LiDAR profile you didn't need anymore to include your module in the controller.

3. In the tilegeneration configuration ``on``/``off`` is no more considered as boolean, it should be
   converted to ``true``/``false``, and the properties ``mapcache_internal`` and ``mapcache`` should be
   removed.

4. For the LiDAR profile you should update your controller, in the interface JavaScript file:

    ```javascript
    + import panels from 'gmfapi/store/panels';

    ...

      constructor($scope, $injector) {
        super($scope, $injector);
    ...
    +   const $timeout = $injector.get('$timeout');
    +
    +   // Open the 'web-component' lidar panel
    +   $scope.$watch(
    +     () => this.drawLidarprofilePanelActive,
    +     (newVal) => {
    +       if (newVal) {
    +         panels.openToolPanel('lidar');
    +       } else {
    +         panels.closeToolPanel();
    +       }
    +     }
    +   );
    +
    +   // Make visible the footer
    +   panels.getActiveFooterPanel().subscribe({
    +     next: (panel) => {
    +       this.lidarProfileFooterActive = panel === 'lidar';
    +       $timeout(() => {}); // this triggered on DOM click, we call $timeout to force Angular digest
    +     },
    +   });
    ...
    ```

    You should disable map interrogations when LiDAR tool is active, if missing add the following code to the controller:
    ```javascript
    +   import ngeoMiscToolActivate from 'ngeo/misc/ToolActivate';

    +   const drawLidarprofilePanelActive = new ngeoMiscToolActivate(this, 'drawLidarprofilePanelActive');
    +   this.ngeoToolActivateMgr.registerTool('mapTools', drawLidarprofilePanelActive, false);
    ```

    The interface HTML file needs a few changes.
    To activate the LiDAR panel, you should makes sure to have correct ng-model attributes:
    {% raw %}
    ```html
    ...
      <button ngeo-btn class="btn btn-default" ng-model="mainCtrl.drawLidarprofilePanelActive"
              data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="left" data-original-title="{{'LiDAR'|translate}}">
        <span class="fa fa-chart-line"></span>
      </button>
    ...
    ```
    {% endraw %}

    The LiDAR panel should looks like that, where other tools panels are:
    ```html
    ...
    +  <div ng-show="mainCtrl.drawLidarprofilePanelActive" class="row">
    +    <div class="col-sm-12">
    +      <a class="btn close gmf-close" ng-click="mainCtrl.drawLidarprofilePanelActive = false">&times;</a>
    +      <gmf-lidar-panel></gmf-lidar-panel>
    +    </div>
    +  </div>
    ...
    ```

    Finally the LiDAR footer in the footer balise should looks like that:
    ```html
     <footer>
    +  <gmf-lidar-footer id="lidar-footer"></gmf-lidar-footer>
       <gmf-profile
         gmf-profile-active="profileChartActive"
         gmf-profile-line="mainCtrl.profileLine"
      ...
     </footer>
    ```

5. Here is a list of the low-level components migrated as a dependency (of other migrated components):
  - download/Csv
  - map/FeatureOverlay
  - map/FeatureOverlayMgr
  - message/Message
  - message/Notification

  All of them use the singleton pattern, which means that in general it may only need to be initialized once (when required).
  The component need to be imported with an 'import', not from the AngularJS dependency injector.

  You should take care of the custom code in that regard if one of these components is used, as it's may needs some changes to be working fully.
  If it is already initialized, you may need to change the code using this component in the custom component of your project.
  In any case, it will be different in each project and use case.

6. To access to the config in you components, previously it was injected through Angular, now you should get
   it with RXJS, with:

   ```javascript
   import {Configuration} from 'gmfapi/store/config';

   window.gmfapi.store.config.getConfig().subscribe({
     next: (configuration: Configuration) => {
       if (configuration) {
         ...
       }
     },
   })
   ```

7. To solve looping dependency we moved the `Cache` and `set_common_headers` function, then you should do
   in your custom Python views a modification like:

   ```diff
   - from c2cgeoportal_geoportal.lib.caching import Cache, set_common_headers
   + from c2cgeoportal_geoportal.lib.common_headers import Cache, set_common_headers
   ```

Main Changes
------------

The migration process impacts the following:
1. Openlayers view has a default value set to `false` for the `constrainOnlyCenter` parameter.
Add to the vars.yaml the following config: `constrainOnlyCenter: True` to `gmfOptions/view` if required to keep 2.5 view behavior.

The migration process will also require the following UI-related changes (visible in the html diffs):
1. Right panel is movable, so the handle has to be added
2. Draw and measure panel has extra fields for arrows drawing

Note: The list presented in this chapter is not exhaustive.


Client application configuration
--------------------------------

Previous versions had configuration in the `*.html.ejs`, in the `Controler*.js`, and in the `vars.yaml` file.
The goal of this change is to move this configuration to the `vars.yaml` file (with default values in
the `CONST_vars.yaml`). This will make future upgrades easier and increase configuration possibilities
in the simple application mode, see the documentation
<https://camptocamp.github.io/c2cgeoportal/${MAIN_BRANCH}/integrator/create_application.html#simple-application>.


When you apply the `ngeo.diff` you should first apply the changes in the `geoportal/vars.yaml` file.

For the next step, you should consult the documentation about:
- The interfaces_config documentation
<https://camptocamp.github.io/c2cgeoportal/${MAIN_BRANCH}/integrator/ngeo.html?highlight=ngeo#dynamic-json-view>
- GMF constants definitions <https://camptocamp.github.io/ngeo/master/jsdoc/module-contribs_gmf_src_options.html>
- ngeo constants definitions <https://camptocamp.github.io/ngeo/master/jsdoc/module-src_options.html>


Then configure the `vars/srid`, `vars/alternate_projections`, `vars/resolutions` and `vars/extent` they will
be dispatched using `c2ctemplate` or YAML link.

In the following, we show typical examples of necessary changes:

-config.searchUrl = '{FULL_ENTRY_POINT}search?interface=api&limit=15';
```

And in your `geoportal/cartoriviera_geoportal/static-ngeo/api/index.js` file:
```
// The URL to the search service.
onfig.searchUrl = '{FULL_ENTRY_POINT}search?interface=api&limit=15';
```

We see that the project settings didn't correspond to the previous default settings, therefore you should
have in your vars file something like:
```
vars:
  interfaces_config:
    api:
      routes:
        searchUrl:
          params:
            limit: 15

update_paths:
  - interfaces_config.api.routes.searchUrl  # This one should already be present
```

In this case, you need to change this line of the `update_paths` as follows:
```
update_paths:
  - interfaces_config.api.routes.searchUrl.params
```

This is because the default value in the
`geoportal/CONST_vars.yaml` defines the searchUrl like this:

```
searchUrl:
  name: fulltextsearch
  params:
    limit: 15
    partitionlimit: 5
  dynamic_params:
    interface: interface
```

You won't redefine the whole `searchUrl` configuration you only want to set the params. The `update_paths`
Allows you to update the one part of the configuration. Without this entry in the `update_paths`, the
whole `searchUrl` configuration would have been replaced.

Example in controller constructor
.................................

In the ngeo.diff:
```
-  constructor($scope, $injector) {
-    super({
-      srid: 2056,
-      mapViewConfig: {
-        center: [2632464, 1185457],
-        zoom: 3,
-        resolutions: [250, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05],
-        constrainResolution: true,
-        extent: [2485071.54, 175346.36, 2828515.78, 1299941.84],
-      }
-    }, $scope, $injector);
```

And in your `geoportal/cartoriviera_geoportal/static-ngeo/api/index.js` file:
```
  constructor($scope, $injector) {
    super({
      maxTilesLoading: Infinity,
      srid: 2056,
      mapViewConfig: {
        center: [2559045, 1144195],
        zoom: 1,
        constrainResolution: true,
        resolutions: [50, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025]
      }
    }, $scope, $injector);
```

We see that the project settings didn't correspond to the previous default settings, therefore you should
have in your vars file something like:
```
vars:
  interfaces_config:
    default:  # or interface name
      constants:
        gmfOptions:
          map:
            maxTilesLoading: .Inf
          view: &view
            projection: EPSG:{srid}
            center: [2559045, 1144195]
            zoom: 1
            resolutions: &resolutions [50, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025]
            extent: &extent [2420000, 1030000, 2900000, 1350000]
          geolocalisation: True
```

Standard example in controller
..............................

In the ngeo.diff:
```
-    this.elevationLayers = ['aster', 'srtm'];
```

And in your `geoportal/cartoriviera_geoportal/static-ngeo/api/index.js` file:
```
   this.elevationLayers = ['mns', 'mnt', 'rayglobal'];
```

We see that the project settings didn't correspond to the previous default settings, therefore you should
have in your vars file something like:
```
vars:
  interfaces_config:
    default:  # or interface name
      constants:
        gmfElevationOptions:
          layers: [mns, mnt, rayglobal]
```

Now we can easily switch between the display of query results in a window or in a grid by using
`gmfQueryGrid` configuration variable.

Now you can easily switch between flush theme mode and non-flush theme mode  by using
`gmfTreeManagerModeFlush` configuration variable.

Optional point
..............

The header can be in a separate file, diff in the `*.html.ejs` file:

    - <header>
    -   <div class="logo">
    -     <span></span>
    -   </div>
    -   <div class="logo-right">
    -     <span></span>
    -   </div>
    - </header>
    + <ng-include src="'desktop_alt/header.html'"></ng-include>

  The content will be in the `geoportal/geomapfish_geoportal/static/header.html` file.

Print
-----

- You can now switch easily between local print and mutualised print by setting one
  of `DISABLE_MUTUALIZED_PRINT` and `DISABLE_LOCAL_PRINT` environment variavle to '#' ant the other to ''.
- The client timezone is added as a new attribute named `timezone`, you can use it with e.-g.:
  `java.time.ZonedDateTime.now().format(java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter
    .ofPattern("EEEE dd MMMM yyyy HH:mm")
    .withLocale($P{REPORT_LOCALE})
    .withZone(java.time.ZoneId.of($P{timezone}))`
- If you use the most recent version of the `legend.jrxml` print template, you will obtain a legend with
  elements indented hierarchically per groups level. If you want to keep the previous legend style, keep
  your previous `legend.jrxml` template and add a new variable `gmfPrintOptions.legend.showGroupsTitle` in
  the `interfaces_config` constants of the vars file and set it to false.

Editing
-------

- The default order column for edition enumeration lists is now the value column ("name" per
  default). You can set it through the new `editingEnumerations` layer metadata.

QGIS server
-----------

- The runtime variables of the GeoMapFish configuration (geomapfish.yaml.tmpl) are now filled in the config
  container, previously it was in the QGIS server container.

Tile generation
---------------

- Some commands are added to generate the OpenLayers example,
  and the legend images used in the WMTS capabilities (but not used in the web application).

Redis
-----

- Redis can be used in a scalable architecture (with sentinel), this is disabled by default.

Environment
-----------

C2C_SECRET: Default value "c2crulez" has been removed for evident security reason.

Changes to apply
================

1. All ngeo components are now configured via variables in your project variables file, in the section
   interfaces_config. To ease future migration, you should remove any existing custom JavaScript code which is
   setting such variables.
   There is some new documentation about the constants in ngeo
   https://camptocamp.github.io/ngeo/{{cookiecutter.geomapfish_main_version}}/apidoc/index.html.

Application build
.................

In the new version the build of the application becomes more Docker friendly.
We didn't anymore have a build container that builds files in the local filesystem, now everything is done
in Docker. The only thing that runs out of docker is the `build` script (that needs Python 3.x) which runs
some `docker build`, and `docker-compose` commands.

Main Changes
------------

The migration process impacts the following:
1. Environment variables are now stored in the env.default and env.project files.
2. .mako files are replaced by .tmpl, this means Python templating isn't possible anymore, (in .tmpl we just have template replacement).
If dynamic variables are needed, you have to write a custom script in `script/config-eval-templates` and add it to the entrypoint into the config image
3. Functionalities in the vars file (2.4) are now stored in the database (2.5) and manageable via the administration interface.
4. In the geoportal folder, there are `static` and `static_ngeo` sub-folders. Since version 2.5 the usage is stricter.
`static` can be used everywhere and is visible by all images, while `static_ngeo` can now only be used in the webpack build.
5. Import of AngularJS library is required in JavaScript files using it, i.e for controllers or components: `import angular from 'angular';`.

The migration process will also require the following UI-related changes (visible in the html diffs):
1. Predefined values in editing form
2. Query selection panel
3. Loading spinners on various elements of the interfaces
4. Geolocation on desktop (add the button)
5. Map swipper

Note: The list presented in this chapter is not exhaustive.


Information
-----------

1. Basic authentication is disabled by default from this version onward.
   To enable basic auth see:
   https://camptocamp.github.io/c2cgeoportal/{{cookiecutter.geomapfish_main_version}}/integrator/security.html#basic-auth

2. We change the secret name from `GITHUB_GOPASS_CI_TOKEN` to `GOPASS_CI_GITHUB_TOKEN` because we can't
   anymore create create secret started with `GITHUB_`.

3. Layers which have any errors are not added to the theme anymore.

4. If a WMS version is given in an OGC server URL, it will be used for the GetCapabilities request
   Supported versions: 1.1.1 and 1.3.0

Changes to apply
----------------

1. Now we need to have PyYAML python package installed in the home,
   see the documentation for more information:
   https://camptocamp.github.io/c2cgeoportal/{{cookiecutter.geomapfish_main_version}}/integrator/requirements.html

2. The configuration vars `vars/functionalities/anonymous` and `vars/functionalities/registered` should
   be moved to the new roles `anonymous` and `registered` that will be created once the database has been upgraded.

3. The 'INSTANCE' configuration variable is removed, it should be in the '.env' files, and also the
   environment makefiles, these contents should also be moved to the '.env' files. In a multi-organization
   project you can have a chain of multiple '.env' files see the build configuration documentation.

4. A new PostgreSQL extension is required, install it by running in psql:
   `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS hstore;`

5. The static files will be moved, therefore you should replace:
   `request.static_url('{{cookiecutter.package}}_geoportal:static/` by:
   `request.static_url('/etc/geomapfish/static/`.

6. Optional, change your mapfiles according the documentation:
   https://camptocamp.github.io/c2cgeoportal/{{cookiecutter.geomapfish_main_version}}/administrator/mapfile.html


Version 2.4.2
=============

Information
-----------

1. The SVG inclusion through Webpack has changed, See ngeo SVG example for more information:
   https://camptocamp.github.io/ngeo/master/examples/svg.html

2. The WMTS capabilities is now generated on runtime.

3. If not already done the 'edit' and 'routing' interfaces and their relations will be removed from the
   database, If you don't want that, you should rename the interfaces before applying the alembic scripts.

4. If not already done the 'api' and 'iframe_api' will be created. After the database upgrade you can run
   the following request to fill e.-g. the api's interfaces with the desktop interface:

    INSERT INTO main.interface_layer (interface_id, layer_id)
    SELECT <api_interface_id>, layer_id FROM main.interface_layer WHERE interface_id = <other_interface_id>;
    INSERT INTO main.interface_theme (interface_id, theme_id)
    SELECT <api_interface_id>, theme_id FROM main.interface_theme WHERE interface_id = <other_interface_id>;
