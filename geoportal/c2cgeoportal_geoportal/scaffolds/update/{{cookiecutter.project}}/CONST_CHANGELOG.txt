This file includes migration steps for each release of c2cgeoportal.


=============
Version 2.8.0
=============

Information to know before starting the upgrade
===============================================


Information
===========

1. We upgraded MapServer to version 8, then the Mapfiles should probably be updated, and we have a new
   configurations file named `mapserver/mapserver.conf`.
   Migration guide: https://mapserver.org/MIGRATION_GUIDE.html#mapserver-7-6-to-8-0-migration.
   Deprecated element from `CLASS` removed (moved to `STYLE`) https://mapserver.org/development/rfc/ms-rfc-133.html#rfc133.

2. We added the support of 'main_ogc_server' to WMS mapserver proxy URL.
    This means that if the value 'vars/main_ogc_server' is present in the vars.yaml of the project,
    that will be used as default value when no 'ogcserver' parameter is present in the request.

3. We switched the OpenLayers renderer to now use WegGL for WMTS. In the case of background tiles with transparency,
    you should add the parameter 'ngeoTilesPreloadingLimit: 0' to the vars.yaml in 'constants' so that background tiles are rendered correctly.

4. In the `user` table, the column `deactivated` is now interpreted more strictly, `null` is now considered as `true`.
