This file includes migration steps for each release of c2cgeoportal.

=============
Version 2.9.0
=============

Information to know before starting the upgrade
===============================================

1. The build command will use Docker Compose version 2 (with the `docker compose` command).

2. RFC 001 - simplification of Ngeo buildtools and custom frontends for GeoMapfish
   https://github.com/camptocamp/GeoMapFish/blob/6f8bffaa1e472cdd8ed3de52c8250b5da62d69de/rfcs/rfc_001.md

   Important points:
   - The `@ngInject` annotation is no more used, you should pass an array in the function or use the `$inject` property,
     see related pull request: https://github.com/camptocamp/ngeo/pull/9453
   - The build will not anymore inline the svg, If you use that you should do it manually,
     see related commit: https://github.com/camptocamp/ngeo/pull/9454/commits/fb3ccfb0bdc8273975cdebfd7dbda401416674c3.
   - Remove the custom SASS plugin to load the SCSS files.
     You should have one SCSS file per interface, the component will not anymore integrate the related style.
     See the related pull request: https://github.com/camptocamp/ngeo/pull/9455.
   - Update Webpack to version 5 and remove Babel transpilation to ES05,
     See the related pull request: https://github.com/camptocamp/ngeo/pull/9463.
   - Update FontAwesome to version 6,
     See the related pull request: https://github.com/camptocamp/ngeo/pull/9470.

3. For the OGC API, the MapServer configuration changes, now multi map files are supported by default and the URL in
   the admin interface should be updated, see the OGC API - Features documentation for more information.

Information
===========

1. Hostname check:
   We add a hostname check on the `came_from` parameter, in the oauth2 login, allowed by
   `vars.authentication.allowed_hosts` and in the OGC server clear cache, allowed by `vars.admin_interface.allowed_hosts`.
   The behavior change a little bit in the `vars.shortener.allowed_hosts` and in the `vars.authorized_referers`.
   Now everywhere:
   - If the hostname (with port) of the candidate URL equals to the request's header "Host", then it's OK.
   - If the hostname (with port) of the candidate URL is in the allowed list, then it's OK.
   And they should be netloc (hostname with port) without schema or path
   (if schema or path is present they are ignored).
   The `vars.allowed_hosts` is added to allowed only some authorized host.

2. We replace checks (formatting) done by `c2cciutils` by `pre-commit` hooks.
   This will me more standard and transparent for the project.

3. The COG layers where added, but are disabled by default.
   To enable them, you need to add the following configuration in the `vars.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   vars:
     admin_interface:
       exclude_pages: []
   ```

4. Previously the `Cache-Control` header was set to `public` when we are not authenticated to an endpoint
   that use the authentication. But this didn't works in every cases, for example when we use the intranet
   role and when we have a reverse proxy with cache. Now it's always set to private for all the endpoints
   that use the authentication.

Changes to apply
================

1. In the Scss file named `geoportal/geomapfish_geoportal/static-ngeo/js/apps/sass/<interface>.scss`
   be sure that you import the `gmf/controller/<interface>.scss` at the top of the file, before you
   can't use the variables.

2. The environment variable TILECLOUD_CHAIN_SESSION_SECRET and TILECLOUD_CHAIN_SESSION_SALT from the file
   `env.project` should be uncomment and filled with a strong secret, e.g. with `pwgen --secure 16`.

3. Nginject migration:
   the @ngInject annotation is no more used, you should pass an array in the function or use the $inject property.
   e.g. before:
   ```javascript
   class Controller {
     /**
      * ...
      * @ngInject
      */
     constructor($scope, $injector) {
       ...
     }
   }
   ```
   e.g. after:
   ```javascript
   class Controller {
     /**
      * ...
      */
     constructor($scope, $injector) {
       ...
     }
   }
   Controller.$inject = ['$scope', '$injector'];
   ```


=============
Version 2.8.0
=============

Information to know before starting the upgrade
===============================================


Information
===========

1. We upgraded MapServer to version 8, then the Mapfiles should probably be updated, and we have a new
   configurations file named `mapserver/mapserver.conf`.
   Migration guide: https://mapserver.org/MIGRATION_GUIDE.html#mapserver-7-6-to-8-0-migration.
   Deprecated element from `CLASS` removed (moved to `STYLE`)
   https://mapserver.org/development/rfc/ms-rfc-133.html#rfc133.

2. We added the support of 'main_ogc_server' to WMS mapserver proxy URL.
   This means that if the value 'vars/main_ogc_server' is present in the vars.yaml of the project,
   that will be used as default value when no 'ogcserver' parameter is present in the request.

3. We switched the OpenLayers renderer to now use WegGL for WMTS. In the case of background tiles with
   transparency, you should add the parameter 'ngeoTilesPreloadingLimit: 0' to the vars.yaml in 'constants'
   so that background tiles are rendered correctly.

4. In the `user` table, the column `deactivated` is now interpreted more strictly, `null` is now considered as `true`.

5. We add the `gmfPrintOptions` in the update path then the default print options are maintained in the
   `CONST_vars.yaml`, especially the `hiddenAttributes`, then if you used the default value it can be
   removed.
