*Administrator* is the person who manages an application built with c2cgeoportal. *Integrator* is the person
who builds the c2cgeoportal application, and does the initial setup. *Developer* is the person who
produces code for c2cgeoportal itself.

The c2cgeoportal project is composed of two software components: NGEO (a JS library based on
`OpenLayers <https://openlayers.org>`_ and `AngularJS <https://angularjs.org/>`_), and c2cgeoportal,
a Python library for the Pyramid web framework.

The :demo:`Demo </>` application shows a WebGIS built with c2cgeoportal.
The :demo:`Demo alternative UI </desktop_alt>` shows the same WebGIS with different user interface
functionalities.
To test the editing functionality, you can use the username 'demo' with the password 'demo'.

The :ngeo_doc:`ngeo (client) documentation can be found here </apidoc/>`.
