# Developing

To develop in the admin interface read the related [README]
(https://github.com/camptocamp/c2cgeoportal/blob/master/admin/README.md).

To develop in the geoportal part you should [create a new application]
(https://camptocamp.github.io/c2cgeoportal/master/integrator/create_application.html),
Then have a look on the [application debugging]
(https://camptocamp.github.io/c2cgeoportal/master/developer/debugging.html) to be able to have your
checkouted code running in the application.
